## Lab session

### Task 1

In session 3 you discussed the process of fitting parameters in an automated way (Task 1e), and how adding together multiple rectified linear units can be used to approximate any function (Task 2e). Spend a couple of minutes to reflect and discuss. Do you remember the key takeaways?

### Task 2

We have created [some slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12j8Jz3PnH9indnhu6bfNqDt1SvbWJPlYOCuxHKS25S8/edit#slide=id.g260ce99ca3c_0_0) that will hopefully make it easier to follow along [the notebook of the week](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jhoward/linear-model-and-neural-net-from-scratch). Use the slides as support while you run through the notebook of the week, and try to understand what's going on.

### Task 3

In this weeks video/ notebook, Jeremy cleans and changes the Titanic dataset so that it is suitable for use in a neural network. In session 7 you will apply these techniques to another dataset. Create a guide for yourself (maybe in a new kaggle notebook?) where the different techniques are presented in the two sections of the notebook called "Cleaning the data" and "Setting up a linear model". Describe the technique briefly, explain when and why we might want to apply the technique and add some example code showing how the technique is applied:
* replace missing values with mode
* taking the log of a variable
* using dummy variables
* normalize variables

### Task 4

### Task 5 - reflection
* Does your team work with tabular data?
* If yes, discuss possible usecases in your team based on what you have learned in this session

### Task 6 (optional, but highly valued)

We are half way through the course! Please spend a few minutes individually and fill out [this feedback form](https://forms.gle/68B7XcxSkeXnFiin8)
