## Lab session

### Task 1

Run through, and try to understand what's going on in the [notebook of the week](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jhoward/how-does-a-neural-net-really-work)


### Task 2 

Reproduce the titanic example from the video in a spreadsheet. We have prepared a spreadsheet for you, and instructions. You'll find both in the shared drive, in the folder for this session.

Note: if you prefer to use Excel you can. We have not managed to make this work in Libre Office Calc. Google-sheets will work for everyone, regardless of operating system.
