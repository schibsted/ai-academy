## Lab session

You will use your project description case in this session.
Agnes Stenbom will guide us through [Schibsteds ethics framework](https://buzz.schibsted.com/home/the-fast-framework). 
The risk analysis that you start creating in this session, can be considered a part of the project, and be presented when you present your project at the end of the course
