## Lab session

During the lab session you are going to hear more about (Schibsted) use cases for NLP.

### Task 1

Run through, and try to understand what's going on in the notebook of the week:

[Week 4 Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jhoward/getting-started-with-nlp-for-absolute-beginners)

If you for some reason are running the code on Colab instead of Kaggle, you will also have to add multiple lines of installing libraries:

    !pip install kaggle
    !pip install datasets
    !pip install transformers[sentencepiece]


### Task 2

Get familiar with the datasets library and using models from the Huggingface hub for tasks such as semantic search or NER. You can have a go at this on your own, but we have prepared a notebook for you if you wish to have a starting poing. You can find the notebook in the shared drive (which is pinned at the top of the slack-channel)


## Additional (optional!) reading
The [Huggingface course](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter0/) is very much recommended if you want to dive deeper into modern day NLP.
