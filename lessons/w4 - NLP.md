## Lab session

During the lab session you are going to hear more about (Schibsted) use cases for NLP.

### Task 1

Run through, and try to understand what's going on in the notebook of the week:

Kaggle:
[Week 4 Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jhoward/getting-started-with-nlp-for-absolute-beginners)

Colab:
[Week 4 Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/fastai/course22/blob/master/slides/nlp-intro.ipynb) (Copy to your drive if you want changes to persist)

If you are running the code on Colab, you will also have to add multiple lines of installing libraries:

    !pip install kaggle
    !pip install datasets
    !pip install transformers[sentencepiece]


### Task 2

Get familiar with the datasets library and using models from the Huggingface hub for tasks such as semantic search or NER. You can have a go at this on your own, but [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Uoh8RB3JNvkAJXv4b8mkGOHaZhkQpW0Q) is also an optional notebook that you can follow.


## Additional (optional!) reading
The [Huggingface course](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter0/) is very much recommended if you want to dive deeper into modern day NLP.
