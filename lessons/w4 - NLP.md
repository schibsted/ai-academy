## Lab session

During the lab session you are going to hear more about LLMs and how they work.

### Task 1

Run through, and try to understand what's going on in the notebook of the week:

[Week 4 Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jhoward/getting-started-with-nlp-for-absolute-beginners)

**Important!**

Instructions on how to access the data for this notebook are written in the first part of the notebook. 

If you for some reason are running the code on Colab (or some other place) instead of Kaggle, you will have to go through the process of fetching the data. You will also have to add multiple lines of installing libraries:

    !pip install kaggle
    !pip install datasets
    !pip install transformers[sentencepiece]


### Task 2

Get familiar with the OpenAI GPT API as well as with the datasets library and using models from the Huggingface hub for tasks such as semantic search or Named Entity Recognition. You can have a go at this on your own, but we have prepared a notebook for you if you wish to have a starting point. You can find the notebook in the shared drive (which is pinned at the top of the slack-channel).

### Reflection

- Does your team work with text data?
- If yes, discuss possible use cases that you can think of when applying these models to your own data.

## Additional (optional!) reading
The [Huggingface course](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter0/) and the [LLM Bootcamp lectures](https://fullstackdeeplearning.com/llm-bootcamp/) are very much recommended if you want to dive deeper into modern day NLP.
