# Week 2 - Production

Welcome to the second lab session! In this session we will focus on how to use a model to clean data, and how to deploy a model on HuggingFace spaces.

## Before the lab session

## Lab session

### Task 1
The aim of this task is to deploy the model you created in the first session, to a Huggingface Space. We have created [the following guide for you](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kNVEPMferZE5Fx6QswFuF5YLCBiIgbGz9nsWKlSItnU/edit?usp=sharing), in an attempt to avoid confusion :D

### Task 2
The aim of this task is to use the model you created in the first session, to clean the data. Open the notebook from last week, where you created your own model, and follow the instructions given [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/aylinmariadursun/clean-data-ai-academy)

### Task 3
Play around with the model your model. If you run out of ideas, you can try the following:
* increase the number of epochs when finetuning. Look at the output. Do you understand what it means?
* repeat finetuning multiple times in a row. Is the output consistent?
* try to plot a confusion matrix
* generate dataloaders from path after the data is cleaned. Does the model improve? Does the confusion matrix change?
