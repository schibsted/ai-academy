The rest of notebook 7 is explained until 51:55 in this week's video. 

The last 40 minutes of the video are part of a walk-through for creating a machine learning model for one of the Kaggle competitions which, while not directly relevant to this week's topic and thus more of a bonus, shows a concrete example on how to apply the techniques learned so far to a specific problem.
