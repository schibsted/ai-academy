# sch AI Academy
Maintainer: @simeneide

> Note to externals: This is an internal repo we currently have released in outside for others to make use of our exercises etc. There are some some (non-secret and irrelevant) internal info in the repo until we get to clean it up.

We mainly follow the very popular AI course fast.ai, but have made some modifications and exercises to make it more Schibsted style. That means that in addition to lessons by Jeremy Howard, we will provide lab sessions where the students will discuss and train their own AI models with the help of instructors from Schibsted.

The course begins by understanding how to apply deep learning. As the course progresses, the student will dive into more details and get a deeper understanding of AI and deep learning, as well as more practical experience in building machine learning models.

- Target audience: Software engineers, data engineers  and other technologists with some coding experience.
- Expected outcome: A good understanding of AI and deep learning. At the end of the course, the student is able to build AI models and understand a rudimentary way of deploying them.
- Course set-up: The students follow a training program that runs over 9 weeks. The estimated required effort is around 4-6 hours/week. At the end of the course, the students will present an AI project related to their interests or daily work.

## Meet the instructors 👋
We are data scientists from across Schibsted and will help you with the exercises and help generate ideas on how to use AI in your daily job. We are:
 Aylin Maria Dursun(consultant), Björn Schiffler (Schibsted P&T), Simen Eide (Schibsted P&T), Stefan Wender (FINN.no), 

## Practical information


On [the landing page](https://course.fast.ai/) for the fast.ai course there is a lot of information/ links/ tasks/ tips & tricks. We don't expect you to do everything, so we've gathered instructions for each lesson in the `lessons/` folder. This should be your starting point for the week, with appropriate links and tasks to all material. (not all weeks are ready yet, so if you are far ahead of schedule you might need to improvise). We will strive towards updating the files for a lab session one week before the lab session. 


All kinds of questions related to the course can be posted in our slack channel. We also hope that you can help each other solving the tasks of the course. We think teaching others is the best way to learn yourself!

### Weekly plan
When the course starts, we will divide you into groups.

In the `lessons/` folder, you can find all info about how to prepare for the lab sessions, and what to do during the lab sessions.

We recommend working together as a group on all parts of the course (preparation + sessions + project). If parts of the material is unclear, discuss it with your group, and/ or post a question on slack.

During the lab session, you will be able to work on the code together with your group, and get help to understand what you did not understand in the lecture and/or notebook earlier.

We also recommend finishing the lab after the lab session, if there is not enough time during the session to complete the notebook.

Remember that you can always ask questions on the slack group if you have any!

One of the weeks will cover ethics. This week might differ slightly, as you will be given an introduction to Schibsteds FAST framework (not to be confused with Fast AI).
